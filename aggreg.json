Sprinkle the rice with the sesame seeds and toasted coconut and serve the sliced mango alongside the rice. (Check out my video tutorial for the fastest way to cut a mango.)Kelly's Notes:To toast the coconut flakes, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and then sprinkle the coconut in an even layer. Bake the coconut for 7 to 10 minutes at 350F, stirring it halfway through, until golden brown.If you've discovered you've undercooked the rice after adding the coconut milk mixture to it, don't panic! Transfer the rice back into the sieve and place the sieve atop the pot of boiling water. Cover it with a towel and a lid and re-steam it the same way you did the first time. Then remove it and stir in a second round of the coconut milk mixture and continue with the recipe as directed. The rice can absorb a significant amount of liquid, so don't hesitate stirring in a second round of the coconut milk mixture.", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/thai-coconut-sticky-rice-with-mango-626762", "dishTypes": ["side dish"], "occasions": [], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 1500, "servings": 6, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": true, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "A Dash of Compassion", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/551706-556x370.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "creditsText": "A Dash of Compassion", "id": 551706, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": false, "title": "Wild leek & potato soup", "diets": ["gluten free", "dairy free", "lacto ovo vegetarian", "whole 30", "vegan"], "pricePerServing": 270.21, "creditText": "A Dash of Compassion", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/8 tsp cayenne pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "cayenne pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg", "amount": 0.125, "consistency": "solid", "id": 2031, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp minced fresh thyme", "aisle": "Produce;Spices and Seasonings", "name": "fresh thyme", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg", "amount": 1.0, "consistency": "solid", "id": 2049, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 garlic clove, minced", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "garlic clove", "metaInformation": ["minced"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "amount": 1.0, "consistency": "solid", "id": 11215, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "30 small wild leeks, chopped (white parts only)", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "leeks", "metaInformation": ["wild", "white", "small", "chopped", "( parts only)"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/leeks.jpg", "amount": 30.0, "consistency": "solid", "id": 11246, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "4 medium red potatoes, cubed", "aisle": "Produce", "name": "red potatoes", "metaInformation": ["red", "medium", "cubed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-potatoes.jpg", "amount": 4.0, "consistency": "solid", "id": 10011355, "unit": ""}, {"originalString": "salt & pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "Salt & Pepper", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt-and-pepper.jpg", "amount": 6.0, "consistency": "solid", "id": 1102047, "unit": "servings"}, {"originalString": "6 cups vegetable stock", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "vegetable stock", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-broth.png", "amount": 6.0, "consistency": "liquid", "id": 6615, "unit": "cups"}], "healthScore": 98.0, "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 99.0, "sourceUrl": "http://www.adashofcompassion.com/2013/05/wild-leek-potato-soup/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": true, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/stock-pot.jpg", "id": 404752, "name": "pot"}], "step": "Heat a stock pot over medium heat.

Then ladle a small amount of chili on top of that! Top with the remaining sport peppers and onions and sprinkle with the corn chips. Take a bite and instantly blog about how surprisingly amazing this combination of ingredients is.                          In a large Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the beef and chorizo and smoosh down. Start breaking up the chunks with a wooden spoon and let sear until the beef is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.                          Remove the meat from the pot and leave the fat. Then add the onions, chili powder, cumin, paprika and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the onions are soft, 7 to 8 minutes. Deglaze with the beer. Cook until the alcohol smell subsides, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the hot sauce, tomatoes, stock and the reserved meat. Simmer until thickened, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes.

Keep the soup warm for serving or allow to cool and save for lunch tomorrow!!While the soup in the fridge cools, lay the thawed puff pastry sheets out flat on a floured work surface. Cut large circles out of the pastry with a ring cutter, about 4 per pastry sheet. Roll up the scraps of pastry dough and roll them back out to cut more circles. Brush each circle with the beaten egg on the outer edge of half of the circle.Once the soup has cooled and is thick, spoon 2-4 tablespoons of the soup into the center of each round of pastry dough. Fold the dough over to cover the filling, making a semi-circle. Use the ends of a fork to seal the edges together. Place the pies on a parchment lined baking sheet.Repeat with the rest of the pastry dough. When all of the pies are on the baking sheet, cut air holes in the top of each pie and then brush the tops with egg wash. Sprinkle with a little cheddar cheese. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes until puffed and nicely browned. Serve warm with the remaining soup for dipping!", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/extra-flakey-broccoli-cheddar-soup-mini-pies-617120", "dishTypes": [], "occasions": ["fall", "winter"], "vegetarian": true, "ketogenic": false, "readyInMinutes": 75, "servings": 16, "sustainable": false, "dairyFree": false, "whole30": false}, {"sourceName": "Sarahs Cucina Bella", "cuisines": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/535243-556x370.jpg", "cheap": false, "gaps": "no", "creditsText": "Sarahs Cucina Bella", "cookingMinutes": 10, "id": 535243, "veryPopular": false, "lowFodmap": true, "title": "Roasted Spicy Herbed Green Olives (Easy Holiday s)", "diets": ["caveman", "gluten free", "dairy free", "lacto ovo vegetarian", "primal", "fodmap friendly", "whole 30", "vegan"], "preparationMinutes": 5, "pricePerServing": 44.0, "creditText": "Sarahs Cucina Bella", "extendedIngredients": [{"originalString": "1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black", "freshly ground"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "amount": 0.25, "consistency": "solid", "id": 1002030, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/4 tsp crushed red pepper", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "crushed red pepper", "metaInformation": ["red", "crushed"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-pepper-flakes.jpg", "amount": 0.25, "consistency": "solid", "id": 1032009, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1/2 tsp dried basil", "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "name": "dried basil", "metaInformation": ["dried"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/basil.jpg", "amount": 0.5, "consistency": "solid", "id": 2003, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "extra virgin olive oil", "metaInformation": [], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg", "amount": 1.0, "consistency": "liquid", "id": 1034053, "unit": "tbsp"}, {"originalString": "1 6-oz can Lindsay Naturals California Green Ripe Olives (pitted)", "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "name": "olives", "metaInformation": ["green", "pitted", "ripe", "canned", "()"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olives-mixed.jpg", "amount": 6.0, "consistency": "solid", "id": 9195, "unit": "oz"}, {"originalString": "1 tsp red wine vinegar", "aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "name": "red wine vinegar", "metaInformation": ["red"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/red-wine-vinegar.jpg", "amount": 1.0, "consistency": "liquid", "id": 1022068, "unit": "tsp"}, {"originalString": "A few sprigs fresh thyme", "aisle": "Produce;Spices and Seasonings", "name": "thyme sprigs", "metaInformation": ["fresh"], "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg", "amount": 3.0, "consistency": "solid", "id": 2049, "unit": "sprigs"}], "healthScore": 1.0, "imageType": "jpg", "spoonacularScore": 23.0, "sourceUrl": "http://sarahscucinabella.com/2013/12/09/roasted-spicy-herbed-green-olives-easy-holiday-recipes/", "glutenFree": true, "vegan": true, "veryHealthy": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 3, "analyzedInstructions": [{"steps": [{"equipment": [{"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/aluminum-foil.png", "id": 404765, "name": "aluminum foil"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg", "id": 404727, "name": "baking sheet"}, {"image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg", "id": 404784, "name": "oven"}], "step": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer chicken and carrots to a serving dish (remove cinnamon stick); top with cilantro and almonds. Season cooking liquid with salt and pepper. Spoon over chicken before serving.                                                                Reprinted from One Pot: 120+ Easy Meals from Your Skillet, Slow Cooker, Stockpot, and More.

Break  185g best dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl. Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them. Now remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to fan 160C/conventional 180C/gas 4 (most ovens take 10-15 minutes to heat up). Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Now tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl, and tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.With a large sharp knife, chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board. The slabs of chocolate will be quite hard, so the safest way to do this is to hold the knife over the chocolate and press the tip down on the board, then bring the rest of the blade down across the chocolate. Keep on doing this, moving the knife across the chocolate to chop it into pieces, then turn the board round 90 degrees and again work across the chocolate so you end up with rough squares.Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar until they look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on howpowerful your mixer is, so don\u2019t lose heart. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume.

Remove from grill, add a spoonful of the mascarpone to each peach (using two spoons, one to scoop and one to scrape and drop it), drizzle with honey, sprinkle with about 1/3 of the granola over top (just so you don't cover the peaches entirely) and garnish with a raspberry and mint. Serve with remaining granola on individual plates and serve immediately.Recipe source: Cooking Classy", "spoonacularSourceUrl":

Add the yolks and whisk for 2 minutes without stopping. Mixture should be pale yellow with thick ribbons. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine the other half of the sugar and milk and stir to combine. Set over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat. Whisking constantly, slowly add hot milk to yolk mixture a few tablespoons at a time. When half of milk mixture has been added, pour the egg mixture back into the pot with the remaining milk and whisk to combine.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Return pan to low heat and continue to whisk as the mixture thickens. Whisk through the lumps until the pastry cream becomes smooth. When it begins to bubble, whisk for two additional minutes, then remove from heat. Whisk in the vanilla extract. With a large rubber spatula, stir in the warm, melted chocolate until it is fully blended. Scrape the pudding out onto the prepared sheet and press another layer of plastic over the surface.

When oven is ready, line chilled pie shell with foil or parchment paper and fill with weights (I reuse dried beans for this), and bake on the lowest rack of the oven for 15 minutes. Remove weights and liner, turn pie, and bake until the bottom crust is a golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove pie shell from oven and allow to cool completely.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            When ready to serve: Place the chilled chocolate pudding in a bowl, it will be very stiff and rubbery. Whisk the pudding until it is smooth. Add 1/4 of the whipped cream, stirring to lighten and incorporate completely into the pudding. Fold in the rest of the cream, reserving approximately 2 ounces, which you will use for piping on top. Scrape the lightened pudding into the cooled pie shell. Pipe the remaining cream on top of the pie and using a microplate or peeler, shave chocolate over the top.

Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.", "pairedWines": ["chardonnay", "pinot noir", "sauvignon blanc"], "productMatches": [{"imageUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430702-312x231.jpg", "description": "Our 2012 vintage has aromas of tropical fruit and butterscotch that lead into a lively blend of pear, pineapple and citrus flavors", "title": "District 7 Estate Chardonnay", "price": "$17.99", "score": 0.75, "link": "https://www.amazon.com/District-Monterey-Estate-Chardonnay-White/dp/B01EXEX4P6?tag=spoonacular-20", "ratingCount": 1.0, "id": 430702, "averageRating": 1.0}]}, "aggregateLikes": 554, "instructions": "Begin by placing the cut up chicken parts in a large stock pot with no more than 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. Cover with water by about an inch - usually about a gallon plus 2 to 3 cups) and let sit for at least 30 minutes while you prep everything else. The point of this is for the apple cider vinegar to extract minerals and calcium from the bones to make your stock even more of a nutritional powerhouse. Read here for more on that!Meanwhile, grab lemongrass, shalltos, garlic, ginger and scallions.Start by separating the scallion greens from the whites. Reserve the greens for a soup or stir fry and slice the whites lengthwise in half.Grab the shallots and without peeling, trim the ends and slice down the middle lengthwise. Peel ginger root (I like to use a teaspoon. You just pull it along the peel and it pretty much slides right off.) and slice into long pieces, exposing the inner flesh.Cut lemongrass into 4\" stalks if not already done and cut the stalks in half lengthwise.Finally, slice the entire head of garlic, leaving skin on, across the middle.Toss all of the cut aromatics into the pot and add 2 to 3 tablespoons of kosher salt. I suggest starting with 2 and tasting later to add more. Bring to a boil and skim foam off the top for 5 to 10 minutes or until it's all gone.Once foam subsides, lower heat to a gentle simmer and cook, covered, for a total of 3 hours.At the beginning of simmering, set a timer for 45 minutes to pull out the 2 breasts and 2 thighs. We want to poach those in the broth and don't want them to get overcooked. Let them cool a bit, pull off the meat and return the bones to the pot. Chop breast and thigh meat up into bite sized pieces and store in a container in the fridge or freezer for future soups (or other dishes).When cooking is done, taste and adjust salt if necessary. Allow to cool and pull out chicken parts. Set aside to cool so you can pick the meat off remaining bones to use for the soup or tacos or chicken salad (whatever you want - it will be a bit dry though).Once stock is a bit cooler, strain into another pot, discard aromatics and refrigerate to allow fat to settle to the top.The next day, pull the pot out of the fridge. You will see a layer of fat settled on the top of the soup. Grab a small bowl or cup and a large spoon. Gently ladle off the fat and discard (some people like to save this to cook with).Your stock is ready to be used or frozen for future use.
